Every procedural (evidentiary) activity should be documented. This protocol is the primary document reflecting the course of the investigation. Regardless of preparing the inspection protocol, this activity can be additionally documented in another way, such as through photography, filming, recording voice on a tape recorder, or creating sketches of the scene. The person leading the inspection team is responsible for conducting the entire documentation of the crime scene, especially for its preparation in accordance with criminal procedure requirements and agreed-upon inspection procedures, as well as for its collection.
