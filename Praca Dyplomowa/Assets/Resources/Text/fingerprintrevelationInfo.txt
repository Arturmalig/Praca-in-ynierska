To reveal fingerprints, we apply powder to the surface. There is a variety of fingerprint powders available on the market, such as magnetic powders, black powders, or white powders. The choice depends on the background color on which the prints are left and the investigator's preference. The surface where fingerprints are sought should be appropriately prepared, free from dust and other contaminants that could interfere with the process. Then, the powder is gently applied to the surface using a brush, brush applicator, or powder sprayer. It is applied evenly, and excess powder is tapped or gently blown to remove it from areas without fingerprints
